After filling in the above "top-matter", as per instructions provided
in the `.md` file, you can write the main body of the blogpost here
onwards. Commonly used examples of syntax are shown below.

You can run `./local_server.sh` at the root of the repository to see
how the final blogpost looks in action.

# Section Heading

## Subsection Heading

Some text.

## Another Subsection Heading

Some more text.
You can write lines
separately
and it'll still
be considered
a single paragraph. Paragraphs are separated by a
blank line.

# Another Section

You can **bold** things by wrapping them in two asterisks/stars. You
can _italicise_ things by wrapping them in underscores. You can also
include inline `code` which is done by wrapping with backticks (the
key likely to the left of the 1 on your keyboard).

If you want to add larger snippets of code, you can add triple
backticks around them, like so:

```
this_is_larger = true;
show_code(true);
```

However, the above doesn't add syntax highlighting. If you want to do
that, you need to specify the specific language on the first line, as
part of the backticks, like so:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello World!");
   return 0;
}
```

If you want to quote someone, simply prefix whatever they said with a
`>`. For example:

> If it is on the internet, it must be true.

-- Abraham Lincoln

You can also nest quotes:

> > You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
>
> -- Wayne Gretzky

-- Michael Scott

Every paragraph _immediately_ after a quote is automatically right
aligned and pressed up against the quote, since it is assumed to be
the author/speaker of the quote. You can suppress this by adding a
`<p></p>` right after a quote, like so:

> This is a quote, whose next para is a normal para, rather than an
> author/speaker

<p></p>

This paragraph is perfectly normal, rather than being forced
right. Additionally, you could also add a `<br />` right beside the
`<p></p>` to give some more breathing room between the quote and the
paragraph.

In the author notifications above, btw, note how the double-hyphen
`--` automatically becomes the en-dash (--) and the triple-hyphen
`---` automatically becomes the em-dash (---). Similarly, double- and
single-quotes are automagically made into "smart quotes", and the
ellipsis `...` is automatically cleaned up into an actual ellipsis...

You can add arbitrary horizontal rules by simply placing three hyphens
on a line by themselves.

---

Of course, you can write \\( \LaTeX \\) either inline by placing stuff
within `\\(` and `\\)` markers, or as a separate equation-style LaTeX
output by wrapping things in `\\[` and `\\]`:

\\[ \sum_{n_1 \in \N} \frac{n_1}{n_2} \\]

Alternatively, you can wrap it inside of a pair of double-dollar signs
`$$`:

$$ \frac{\Phi \in \psi}{\psi \rightarrow \xi} $$

Single dollar signs unfortunately do not work for inline LaTeX.

# More fun!

Of course, you can add links to things, by using the right syntax. For
example, [here is a link to NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). Standard
HTML-like shenanigans, such as appending a `#anchor` to the end of the
link also work. Relative links within the website also work.

You can also use the links to link back to parts of the same
blogpost. For this, you need to find the "slug" of the section. For
this, you can force a slug at the section heading, and then simply
refer to it, like the [upcoming section](#finale), or alternatively,
you can take the lowercase version of all the parts of a section and
place hyphens between them, like [this](#more-fun) or
[this](#another-section).

Pictures, of course, can be added. The best way to do this is to
utilize relative links (just add images into the right directory), but
you can link to external images too in the same way. For example,

![i are serious cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/CatLolCatExample.jpg)

Of course, it is good etiquette to add alt-text to your images, like
has been done in the previous image. It helps with accessibility.

Images are automatically shown at a reasonable size by limiting their
maximum width. If you have a particularly tall image, you might have
to do some manipulation yourself though. Images should also
automatically work properly in mobile phones :)

Do you want some tables? Here are some tables:


| Header 1   | Another header here   | This is a long header |
|:---------- | ---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Some data  | Some more data        | data \\( \epsilon \\) |
| data       | Some _long_ data here | more data             |
| align left |   right               | center                |

You use the `:` specifier in the table header-body splitting line to
specify whether the particular column should be left, center, or right
aligned. All the standard markdown elements continue to work within
the table, so feel free to use them.

# Finale {#finale}

Finally, you're at the end of your blogpost! Your name will appear
again at the end automatically, as will the committee members who will
(hopefully) approve your blogpost with no changes! Good luck!
